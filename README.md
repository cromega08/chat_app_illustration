## My process

Started with a vertical design and placing the items on a template. After that, only set clases for elements on each side and added @media-queries to set the different sizes for differents size screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- @media-queries

### Continued development

Responsive design, but without @media-queries, think can make the process more efficient.
